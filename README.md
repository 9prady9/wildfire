========
I am currently working on creating a GUI application using [Qt5](http://qt-project.org/) that using [ArrayFire](http://www.arrayfire.com/docs/) as compute backend for performing image editing operations.

First phase will be do create functions using ArrayFire that does the necessray edit operation. Once the compute part is working fine, I shall proceed to the UI creation.

Progress: I have been busy with our scientific computing library ArrayFire for the past six months and didn't continue working on this repository. Now that we have open sourced our ArrayFire, i shall soon resume work on this Image Editing application.

To-Date

I have added a single c++ source file that has the initial set of functions that let me do the following operations.

* Contrast modification
* Brightness modification
* Image translation
* Digital zoom
* Alpha blending
* Unsharpmask
