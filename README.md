========
I am currently working on creating a GUI application using [Qt5](http://qt-project.org/) that using [ArrayFire](http://www.arrayfire.com/docs/) as compute backend for performing image editing operations.

First phase will be do create functions using ArrayFire that does the necessray edit operation. Once the compute part is working fine, I shall proceed to the UI creation.

* Contrast modification
* Brightness modification
* Image translation
* Digital zoom
* Alpha blending
* Unsharpmask
